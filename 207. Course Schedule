There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


According to my code test, BFS is much faster than DFS. From my perspective DFS searches more branches. EX: 1->3->4 //1->5->3 the first branch we need search 3's children, in second we still need to do so.

BFS:

public class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        int[] degree = new int[numCourses];
        Queue queue = new LinkedList();
        int count=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<numCourses;i++)
            graph[i] = new ArrayList();
            
        for(int i=0; i<prerequisites.length;i++){
            degree[prerequisites[i][1]]++;
            graph[prerequisites[i][0]].add(prerequisites[i][1]);
        }
        for(int i=0; i<degree.length;i++){
            if(degree[i] == 0){
                queue.add(i);
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        while(queue.size() != 0){
            int course = (int)queue.poll();
            for(int i=0; i<graph[course].size();i++){
                int pointer = (int)graph[course].get(i);
                degree[pointer]--;
                if(degree[pointer] == 0){
                    queue.add(pointer);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        if(count == numCourses)
            return true;
        else    
            return false;
    }
}
DFS:

public class Solution {
        public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
            ArrayList[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
            for(int i=0;i<numCourses;i++)
                graph[i] = new ArrayList();
                
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCourses];
            for(int i=0; i<prerequisites.length;i++){
                graph[prerequisites[i][1]].add(prerequisites[i][0]);
            }

            for(int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
                if(!dfs(graph,visited,i))
                    return false;
            }
            return true;
        }

        private boolean dfs(ArrayList[] graph, boolean[] visited, int course){
            if(visited[course])
                return false;
            else
                visited[course] = true;;

            for(int i=0; i<graph[course].size();i++){
                if(!dfs(graph,visited,(int)graph[course].get(i)))
                    return false;
            }
            visited[course] = false;
            return true;
        }
    }
