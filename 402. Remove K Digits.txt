Whenever meet a digit which is less than the previous digit, remove the previous one.
Best data structure: stack

After removing k digits, leading digit might be zero, so we have to make sure to remove those before returning.

Think of corner cases, k == length of array. Then we return zero
Number = 1111, what to do here? Just remove k 1s (just pop k from stack)
Number = 123456789, then remove k from the back. They should be in the stack so it's just popking k from stack.
